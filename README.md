# Noisette - The nuts-breaker Obfuscator
Noisette (nuts in French) is aimed to be an Obfuscator for .NET assembly built with ![dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib), GDI and my humble coding skills.

## How do I test it?
It's written : drag and drop a .NET file on it. It will create a %yourfile%_protected output in the same folder.

## How much does it impact the file size?
Original is 22Kb, protected file is 27,5Kb. I've seen worse.

## What features does it have?
For the moment, only a few, if you want a really strong ready-to-use Obfuscator have a look at ![NETGuard.io](http://netguard.io)
* Constant Outlinning
- Strings Outlinning
- Renaming
- Invalid Metadata
- Watermarking

## How do I report a problem?
Trick question, I don't care about your problems.
